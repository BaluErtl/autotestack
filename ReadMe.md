# autotestack

A proven working software stack for running automated tests with the following order of components: Gherkin ▸ Behat ▸ Mink ▸ Selenium ▸ WebDriver ▸ Facebook's PHP-binding ▸ ChromeDriver ▸ Google Chrome ▸ on mac OS.

See the [composer.json](https://github.com/BaluErtl/autotestack/blob/master/composer.json) file for further details.

Initial foundation of this stack was based on the toolset introduced in the [Behat 101 - Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7RHtNePY3Y) screencast by @jcowie and @allanmacgregor on YouTube. I'm so thankful for them to shed some lights on a working combination.
